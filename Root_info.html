<!-- Notes -->
<!-- In HTML, you can either use double quotes or single quotes to enclose attribute values both have same values but is often recommended to use double quotes--> 

<!-- In html we have 2 categories in tags namely semantic and non-semantic :
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
eg : <form>, <table>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <main>

A non-semantic element tells nothing about its content.
eg : <div> and <span>  -->

    <!-- We have 2 types of tags : pair tags and self-closing tags -->
<!-- You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document.  -->

    <!-- Its called markup language because it marks the information by tagging them. -->

    <!-- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. -->

    <!-- use <br/> like this . Its recommended -->
    <!-- everytime u write something write in para tag -->
    <!-- make habit of using strong and em tag rahter than b,i or u bec we've to provide structure. for the latter tags we can use css -->
    <!-- type article+section and both the tags will come bec of emmet-->
    <!-- make use of span tag to bring the content in same line -->
